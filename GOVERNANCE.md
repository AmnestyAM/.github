## Trademarks

AspirePress is a trademark of Tailwinds, LLC. We reserve all rights to this trademark. You may use it to accurately describe what you are offering (e.g., "we host an AspirePress mirror"), but you may NOT use the AspirePress trademark in any way that implies endorsement or official affiliation with AspirePress (e.g., "we're an official AspirePress partner" or "we are AspirePress").

For clarification or questions, reach out to support@aspirepress.org. Permission to use the trademark for legitimate purposes will not be unreasonably withheld.

If you earn money from your use of this code, you may only use the trademark to imply that your service is "powered by AspirePress." For example, a hosting company called FooHosting might say, "FooHosting CDN - Powered by AspirePress."

If you use the trademark, you must link to AspirePress.org in a prominent location and include the following text:

"AspirePress is a trademark of Tailwinds LLC. All rights reserved. Used under fair use and in compliance with the trademark policy."
